# NFL
This is a group project for my Python class at SCU. I was the project leader of a group of four. The goal of this project was to detect three interesting, nontrivial, and somewhat unexpected finding in a real-world data set of your choice. I chose an NFL database from 2017 and came up with 3 major findings:
* Where NFL Players come from (universities, places of birth, etc.)
* Data Visualization of NFL Players
* Machine Learning Classification Tree to Predict if a Quarterback will continue playing or not
